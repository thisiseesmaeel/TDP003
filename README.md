# TDP003 - Project: Personal Computer Environment

This course is the first of a suite of project courses for the Innovative Programming education. In this course you will work in pairs to build your own portfolio software in Python 3. The portfolio is a tool you can use to collect information about your own projects during the education. 

The project course runs parallel to the Imperative Programming course, where you learn programming and problem solving (in the Python programming language). This provides a realistic learning situation where you alternate between subject courses and projects. The project's goal is for you to create a portfolio system in Python and the course's goal is for you to learn the basics of working with software projects and useful techniques and tools. Your portfolio can (should) then be used to document and be able to show the programs, projects and systems you make in later courses, including this one.
